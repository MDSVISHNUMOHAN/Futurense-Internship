Q1}Write a Python program to calculate the product, multiplying all the numbers in a given tuple.

For the first question, we need to write a Python program that calculates the product of all the numbers in a given tuple. The approach is straightforward: initialize a product variable to 1 and then multiply it by each number in the tuple using a loop.

Q2}Write a Python program to calculate the average value of the numbers in a given tuple of tuples.

For the second question, you're asked to calculate the average value of the numbers in a given tuple of tuples. This involves calculating the sum of each inner tuple's elements and then dividing by the length of the inner tuple. You do this for each inner tuple and return the results in a list.
